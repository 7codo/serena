#   (This list may be outdated. For the current list, see values of Language enum here:
#   https://github.com/oraios/serena/blob/main/src/solidlsp/ls_config.py
#   For some languages, there are alternative language servers, e.g. csharp_omnisharp, ruby_solargraph.)
# Note:
#   - For C, use cpp
#   - For JavaScript, use typescript
#   - For Free Pascal/Lazarus, use pascal
# Special requirements:
#   Some languages require additional setup/installations.
#   See here for details: https://oraios.github.io/serena/01-about/020_programming-languages.html#language-servers
# When using multiple languages, the first language server that supports a given file will be used for that file.
# The first language is the default language and the respective language server will be used as a fallback.
# Note that when using the JetBrains backend, language servers are not used and this list is correspondingly ignored.
